# Portfolio V2

This is the second version of my portfolio – designed and developed in my final year of the Computer Programming & Analysis program at George Brown College.

## 🚀 About This Version

V2 is a complete redesign with a modern layout, better responsiveness, and added interactivity. This version showcases my best work in a more dynamic and structured format, with animated elements, and custom modal project previews.
